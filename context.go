	// Context is the midle-man server's "object" for the clients.
	//
	// A New context is being acquired from a sync.Pool on each connection.
	// The Context is the most important thing on the siris's http flow.
	//
	// Developers send responses to the client's request through a Context.
	// Developers get request information from the client's request by a Context.
	Context = context.Context

	// A Handler responds to an HTTP request.
	// It writes reply headers and data to the Context.ResponseWriter() and then return.
	// Returning signals that the request is finished;
	// it is not valid to use the Context after or concurrently with the completion of the Handler call.
	//
	// Depending on the HTTP client software, HTTP protocol version,
	// and any intermediaries between the client and the siris server,
	// it may not be possible to read from the Context.Request().Body after writing to the context.ResponseWriter().
	// Cautious handlers should read the Context.Request().Body first, and then reply.
	//
	// Except for reading the body, handlers should not modify the provided Context.
	//
	// If Handler panics, the server (the caller of Handler) assumes that the effect of the panic was isolated to the active request.
	// It recovers the panic, logs a stack trace to the server error log, and hangs up the connection.
	Handler = context.Handler

	Map = context.Map

  // Supervisor is a shortcut of the `host#Supervisor`.
  // Used to add supervisor configurators on common Runners
  // without the need of importing the `core/host` package.
  Supervisor = host.Supervisor

	// Party is just a group joiner of routes which have the same prefix and share same middleware(s) also.
	// Party could also be named as 'Join' or 'Node' or 'Group' , Party chosen because it is fun.
	//
	// Look the `core/router#APIBuilder` for its implementation.
	//
	// A shortcut for the `core/router#Party`, useful when `PartyFunc` is being used.
	Party = router.Party
